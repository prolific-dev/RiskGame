### Project in Software-Engineering

In this project we will implement our own version of the public and well-known "Risk Game".
Therefore, we are going to use Scala as our primary programming language.
Along this course we will utilize and learn about several Software-Engineering techniques
to keep our Code scalable and testable to assure quality.
