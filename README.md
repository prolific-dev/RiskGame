### Project in Software-Engineering

In this project we will implement our own version of the public and well-known "Risk Game". Therefore, we are going to
use Scala as our primary programming language. Along this course we will utilize and learn about several
Software-Engineering techniques to keep our Code more scalable and testable, so we can assure and guarantee quality.
